# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

## Install required package

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --force`

This will install all required packages for this project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm install -g serve`

Install the Static Server

### `serve -s build`

Sets up HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html

### `serve -s build -l [port] ` optional

This will help to change the port

Create a TODO app as a responsive, professionally-looking SPA with React, (mandatory) React
Hooks, (optionally) Redux, and Bootstrap. There will be no server component; so, store all state
locally. Letâ€™s call this a UI prototype.
Note, setup the project using NPM instead of Yarn. We will not have Yarn installed and will
consider this exercise a failure if your submission requires Yarn

## The project has created using `npm init react-app [appname]`

It includes two pages Login and Main. The email and password have stored locally using which user can log in

## Login details

email: admin@admin.com

password : admin123

username : (Note : username can be anything)

## Todo main

User can enter unlimited todo to the list  
 Added todo is visible below which has fields
1.ID 2. User ID 3. Title 4. Description 5. State
a. TODO
b. In Progress
c. Done

## Todo section

" = " is the Drag icon using which user can drag and sort the todo in the droppable area (Todo list)

Note : `npm i react-beautiful-dnd` is used to achieve drag functionality

User can Toggle the state between 'Todo' and "Done" by clicking the Title,State and Description fields

## Tools field

1)Play icon : user can toggle the state between 'Todo' and 'In progress' by clicking the 'Play icon' on the tools field

2)View icon : user can have a complete view with other field details

3)Edit icon : user can edit the particular todo and update

4)Delete icon : user can delete the particular todo

## Filter section

1. Title : sorts the todo list alphabetically with title value.
2. Todo : sorts the todo list which has a 'state : Todo'.
3. In progress : sorts the todo list which has a 'state : In progress'.
4. Done : sorts the todo list which has a 'state : Done'.
5. Clear filter : clears the filter and updates original data.

The app is made responsive using `npm i bootstrap` and tools icons are added using `npm react-icons`
